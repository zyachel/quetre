First of all, thanks for reading this document!

## Bugs and issues

If you happen to come across and issue or bug in Quetre, You can create a new issue by clicking [here](https://github.com/zyachel/quetre/issues/new/choose). (You can also go to the GitHub issues tab).

**Issues can be feature requests too!**

Here are some nice tips for helpful issues:

- **Use a good title**

  Issue titles are important since we use them to organize the issue board, therefore, please choose titles that are short and describe the issue in detail.
  
- **Include every detail you can think of**

  This means logs, tracebacks, use cases (if the issue is about a feature)...
  
## Pull requests and commits

If you wish to contribute code, you can do so by forking the repository, doing the changes and then opening a pull request for your changes to be reviewed.
