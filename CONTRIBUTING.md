## Bugs and issues

If you happen to come across and issue or bug in Quetre, You can create a new issue by clicking [here](https://github.com/zyachel/quetre/issues/new/choose). (You can also go to the GitHub issues tab).

**Issues can be feature requests too!**

Here are some nice tips for helpful issues:

- Use a good title
  Issue titles are important since we use them to organize the issue board, therefore, please choose titles that are short and describe the issue in detail.
- Include every detail you can think of
  This means logs, tracebacks, use cases (if the issue is about a feature)...
  
## Pull requests and commits

If you wish to contribute code, you can do so by forking the repository, doing the changes and then opening a pull request for your changes to be reviewed.

We just please ask you to write commit messages using the [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en), there is a tool called [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) *(or CZ)* that automatically formats and names your commit using this standard, in case you are interested.
